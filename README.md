# Sensasi Dictionary Docs Template

This repository is a template for building a dictionary web page using [Sensasi Dictionary SSG](https://github.com/sensasi-delight/sensasi-dictionary-ssg)

The preview of the generated web page can be seen [here](https://sensasi-delight.github.io/sensasi-dictionary-preview).

## How to use

1. Click the green button `Use this template` on the top right of this page.
2. Fill the form and click `Create repository from template`.
3. Activate GitHub Pages in the repository settings.
4. Enable GitHub Actions in the repository settings.

Now you can start writing your dictionary entries. See the [conventions](#conventions) below. After you push your changes, the GitHub Actions will automatically build the web page and publish it to GitHub Pages.

## Conventions

- All dictionary entry files should be written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
- The file name should be the same as the word in the entry. For example, the entry for the word `sensasi` should be written in a file named `sensasi.md`.
- The file should be placed in their respective folder, which is the first letter of the word. For example, the entry for the word `sensasi` should be placed in the folder `s`.

For example, see the [e/example.md](https://github.com/sensasi-delight/sensasi-dictionary-preview/tree/main/e/example.md) file. The preview of 'Example' entry can be seen [here](https://sensasi-delight.github.io/sensasi-dictionary-preview/terms/example).
